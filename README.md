# Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)

**Recursive. Prime-driven. Quantum-inspired.**
This is the landing page for the **Self-Emergent Processor** framework — a system where **identity and meaning** emerge from **prime-based recursion**. Think of it as a perpetual engine that eats prime numbers and spits out structure.

### What Is SEP?
A prime-indexed, recursive system that starts simple and keeps stacking rules onto itself. Each new prime is like a cosmic “tick” that might spin the system into new territory, yet patterns and coherence still form. It’s half quantum vibe, half number theory black magic, and fully open for exploration.

### Quick Highlights
- **Prime Gauge Theory:** Each prime is a discrete “symmetry generator,” updating the state in a gauge-like fashion.
- **Emergent Identity:** Over time, the system settles into stable patterns — it’s like chaos forging its own order.
- **Number-Theoretic Bridges:** Connects to Riemann zeta, prime distributions, possible insights into deep conjectures.
- **Entropy & Meaning:** New primes increase complexity, but SEP hunts for compressible patterns, turning noise into knowledge.

### Repo & Docs

- [**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName) – Code, issues, updates (replace with your link).

### Roadmap
1. **Finalize a canonical `U(p, s)` rule.** Right now, it’s flexible — we want a crisp function that merges prime data with self-reference.
2. **Simulation & Visualization.** We’ll build simple examples first, then scale up to big prime sets.
3. **Quantum / Number Theory Collisions.** Explore how SEP resonates with known prime phenomena (Riemann zeros, etc.).

Have a blast exploring the **Self-Emergent Processor**! If you find new patterns or want to push this further, send a PR or open an issue.
