# Demo Tasks Checklist

The following tasks ensure each interactive demo aligns with the narrative and documentation.

## Scene 1: "The Hidden Code" – Wave Interference
- [ ] Verify multi-wave superposition renders clearly.
- [ ] Display Fourier transform of the resulting signal in real time.
- [ ] Standing waves should appear when boundaries are aligned.

## Scene 2: "Identity Through Distinction" – Angle Classification
- [ ] Provide draggable vectors for angle measurement.
- [ ] Color code acute, right, and obtuse angles.
- [ ] Show cosine values as the angle changes.

## Scene 3: "Cosine Alignment" – Vector Dot Product
- [ ] Visualize collisions with cosine intensity coloring.
- [ ] Ensure acute impacts produce contained rebounds.
- [ ] Threshold for lattice formation adjustable by the user.

## Scene 4: "Sine Deviation" – Tangent Explosion
- [ ] Include slider to sweep angle toward 90° and show tangent blowup.
- [ ] Spring animation must reflect restoring forces at the boundary.

## Scene 5: "Angle Reality Classification" – Three-Body Problem
- [ ] Angle-based coloring for stable vs escaping trajectories.
- [ ] Allow switching perspective between bodies.

## Scene 6: "Boundary Enforcement" – Billiard π Emergence
- [ ] Blocks must resize via new block size control.
- [ ] Collision counter should update π approximation live.
