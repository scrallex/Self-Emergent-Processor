# Demo Validation Tasks

Each task below outlines what must be verified or implemented for the corresponding demo scene. These tasks ensure that the implementation aligns with the descriptions in `assets/js/demos/config/scene-registry.js` and related documentation.

## Scene 1 – The Hidden Code
- [ ] Display interactive wave superposition of multiple sine components.
- [ ] Provide real-time Fourier transform visualization.
- [ ] Show how boundaries create standing waves.

## Scene 2 – Identity Through Distinction
- [ ] Interactive protractor for building angles by dragging vectors.
- [ ] Color-code angles as acute, right, or obtuse with live cosine values.
- [ ] Sweep across angles and display Fourier decomposition.

## Scene 3 – Cosine Alignment
- [ ] Physics-based billiard collision with cosine overlay.
- [ ] Highlight acute vs right-angle impacts and lattice formation.
