# Demo Verification Tasks

This checklist outlines key requirements for each demo scene. Use it to verify that visualizations align with the concepts described in the documentation and video script.

## Scene 1 – Wave Interference
- [ ] Show multiple sine waves combining into complex patterns
- [ ] Include real-time Fourier transform output
- [ ] Highlight standing wave formation at boundaries

## Scene 2 – Geometric Classification
- [ ] Interactive protractor measuring angle between draggable vectors
- [ ] Color‑coded angle types (acute, right, obtuse)
- [ ] Display cosine values updating as the angle changes

## Scene 3 – Vector Dot Product
- [ ] Simulate billiard-ball collisions with cosine-based coloring
- [ ] Acute impacts remain bright and contained
- [ ] Right-angle collisions result in separation

## Scene 4 – Tangent Explosion
- [ ] Visualize sine and tangent curves as angle approaches 90°
- [ ] Show restoring "spring" force from boundaries
- [ ] Demonstrate tangent blowup when deviation becomes large

## Scene 5 – Three‑Body Problem
- [ ] Interactive gravity system with angle‑based coloring
- [ ] Acute interactions lead to stable orbits
- [ ] Obtuse angles push bodies to escape trajectories

## Scene 6 – Billiard Pi
- [ ] Colliding blocks compute π from the collision count
- [ ] Mass ratio and initial speed are adjustable
- [ ] **Block size can be changed during simulation**

## Scene 7 – Prime Spiral
- [ ] Plot prime numbers on an Ulam spiral grid
- [ ] Allow perspective switching and zooming

## Scene 8 – Flocking Simulation
- [ ] Boids avoid orthogonal collisions using cosine alignment
- [ ] Observe rotational or dispersive patterns by adjusting angles

## Scene 9 – QBSA/QFH Demo
- [ ] Visualize 64‑bit state grid with rupture detection
- [ ] Provide spectral analysis of coherence

## Scene 10 – Particle Fluid
- [ ] Constrain particles so they do not hit the plane directly
- [ ] Display vorticity coloring and lattice emergence

## Scene 11 – Black‑Scholes Options
- [ ] Boundary thickness modulates volatility
- [ ] Compare traditional and SEP pricing surfaces

## Scene 12 – Unified Field
- [ ] Combine waves, primes and flocking into a single meta visualization
- [ ] Show coherence waves propagating through the scene
