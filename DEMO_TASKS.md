# Demo Verification Tasks

This checklist outlines goals for each SEP demonstration scene. Use these tasks to ensure visuals and interactions align with the descriptions in `assets/js/demos/config/scene-registry.js`.

## Scene 1: The Hidden Code
- [ ] Allow frequency and amplitude adjustments for multiple waves.
- [ ] Display real-time Fourier transform of the combined signal.
- [ ] Highlight standing waves at the canvas boundaries.

## Scene 2: Identity Through Distinction
- [ ] Provide draggable vectors to measure angles with a protractor overlay.
- [ ] Color-code acute, right and obtuse cases while showing cosine values.
- [ ] Include Fourier decomposition when sweeping through angles.

## Scene 3: Cosine Alignment
- [ ] Simulate billiard collisions with a cosine-based energy overlay.
- [ ] Show contained bounces for acute impacts and separation for right angles.
- [ ] Visualize lattice formation when cosine passes the threshold.

## Scene 4: Sine Deviation
- [ ] Offer an angle slider with sine and tangent plots.
- [ ] Animate a spring force that grows as tangent approaches infinity.
- [ ] Integrate normal forces on a billiard ball at high deviation.

## Scene 5: Angle Reality Classification
- [ ] Run a three-body gravity simulation with angle-based color coding.
- [ ] Distinguish stable orbits from escape trajectories.
- [ ] Demonstrate perspective switching between bodies.

## Scene 6: Boundary Enforcement
- [ ] Approximate Ï€ through block collisions while tracking collision counts.
- [ ] Visualize frequency-domain emergence and elasticity thresholds.

## Scene 7: Prime Uniqueness
- [ ] Plot primes on a grid forming spiral or trajectory patterns.

- [ ] Show composite numbers decomposing into multi-path configurations.

## Scene 8: Multi-Perspective Coherence
- [ ] Implement boids with cosine-weighted alignment and obtuse dispersion.
- [ ] Encourage rotational flock patterns without orthogonal collisions.

## Scene 9: SEP Operationalization
- [ ] Display a 64-bit state grid for QBSA and QFH operations.
- [ ] Highlight rupture detections and spectral analysis in real time.

## Scene 10: Particle Fluid
- [ ] Provide particle-based fluid motion colored by vorticity.
- [ ] Enforce boundary rotation and allow adding vortices.

## Scene 11: Derivative Applications
- [ ] Plot option pricing surfaces with adjustable grid resolution.
- [ ] Compare traditional and SEP calculations with speedup metrics.
- [ ] Allow changing the surface block size.

## Scene 12: Reality's Code
- [ ] Combine elements from previous scenes into a unified visualization.
- [ ] Show primes, angles and coherence waves interacting together.
