# Demo Improvement Checklist

This document lists tasks for each demo scene based on the descriptions in
`assets/js/demos/config/scene-registry.js`. Use these tasks to verify that the
implementation matches the documented goals.

## Scene 1: The Hidden Code - Wave Interference
- [ ] Overlay multiple sine and cosine waves with adjustable frequency.
- [ ] Display a real-time Fourier transform of the combined signal.
- [ ] Highlight standing waves formed by screen boundaries.

## Scene 2: Identity Through Distinction - Angle Classification
- [ ] Provide an interactive protractor with draggable vectors.
- [ ] Color code acute, right and obtuse angles as described.
- [ ] Show live cosine values during angle adjustment.

## Scene 3: Cosine Alignment - Billiard Collision
- [ ] Simulate billiard balls with angle-based color intensity.
- [ ] Demonstrate lattice formation when alignment exceeds threshold.

## Scene 4: Sine Deviation - Tangent Explosion
- [ ] Plot sine and tangent curves with a boundary slider.
- [ ] Animate a spring showing restoring force near 90°.

## Scene 5: Angle Reality Classification - Three Body Problem
- [ ] Allow adjustable starting positions for three masses.
- [ ] Color trajectories by angle type and show perspective switching.

## Scene 6: Boundary Enforcement - Pi Calculation
- [ ] Collide two blocks with mass ratio control to approximate π.
- [ ] Visualize collision count and frequency domain emergence.

## Scene 7: Prime Uniqueness - Prime Spiral
- [ ] Render an Ulam spiral with trajectories for composite numbers.
- [ ] Allow zooming and highlight y=x boundary lines.

## Scene 8: Multi-Perspective Coherence - Flocking
- [ ] Implement cosine-weighted alignment and obtuse dispersion forces.
- [ ] Expose controls for flock size and block (boid) size.

## Scene 9: SEP Operationalization - QBSA/QFH Demo
- [ ] Display a 64‑bit state grid with rupture detection visual cues.
- [ ] Show spectral analysis bars from the QFH algorithm.

## Scene 10: Particle Fluid
- [ ] Compute vorticity coloring while enforcing boundary rotation.
- [ ] Support mouse interaction for adding swirls.

## Scene 11: Derivative Applications - Black‑Scholes
- [ ] Plot volatility surface comparing SEP and traditional solutions.
