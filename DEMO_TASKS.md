# Demo Tasks Checklist

This checklist outlines verification steps for each interactive demo to ensure it matches the features described in the project documentation and scene registry.

## Scene 1 – The Hidden Code
- [ ] Confirm wave interference displays multiple sine waves combining.
- [ ] Verify Fourier transform output updates in real time.

## Scene 2 – Identity Through Distinction
- [ ] Angle classification should color vectors as acute, right, or obtuse.
- [ ] Cosine value must update dynamically with angle changes.

## Scene 3 – Cosine Alignment
- [ ] Billiard balls collide with cosine-based color overlay.
- [ ] Right-angle impacts should visibly separate balls.

## Scene 4 – Sine Deviation
- [ ] Sine and tangent plots respond to slider input.
- [ ] Tangent grows rapidly near ninety degrees.

## Scene 5 – Angle Reality Classification
- [ ] Gravitational three-body demo uses angle coloring for trajectories.
- [ ] Obtuse angles trigger escape paths while acute ones orbit.

## Scene 6 – Boundary Enforcement
- [ ] Billiard simulation approximates π using collision counts.
- [ ] Mass ratio slider influences collision frequency.

## Scene 7 – Prime Uniqueness
- [ ] Prime numbers appear on a spiral grid.
- [ ] Composite numbers follow multi-path visualizations.

## Scene 8 – Multi-Perspective Coherence
- [ ] Boids flock together using cosine-based alignment forces.
- [ ] Obtuse headings cause group dispersion.

## Scene 9 – SEP Operationalization
- [ ] 64‑bit grid shows quantum state pins.
- [ ] QBSA rupture detection flashes red on violations.

## Scene 10 – Particle Fluid
- [ ] Particle size is adjustable with the control slider.
- [ ] Boundary collisions induce visible rotation patterns.

## Scene 11 – Derivative Applications
- [ ] Surface plot updates when volatility slider changes.
- [ ] Display traditional vs SEP calculation times.

## Scene 12 – Reality's Code
- [ ] Combined visualization layers from prior scenes appear.
- [ ] Central angle modulation responds to speed/intensity presets.
