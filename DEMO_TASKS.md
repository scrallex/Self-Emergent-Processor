# Demo Implementation Tasks

This file outlines specific tasks for each interactive demo scene. Complete these items to ensure every demo fulfills the goals described in the project documentation.

## Scene 1 – Wave Interference
- [ ] Render multiple sine waves that can be superposed interactively.
- [ ] Provide real‑time Fourier transform visualization.
- [ ] Display standing waves at the screen boundaries.

## Scene 2 – Identity Through Distinction
- [ ] Implement an interactive protractor to create and measure angles.
- [ ] Color code acute, right, and obtuse angles.
- [ ] Update cosine values continuously during interaction.

## Scene 3 – Cosine Alignment
- [ ] Simulate billiard ball collisions highlighting the cosine of the impact angle.
- [ ] Show containment for acute collisions and separation for right angles.

## Scene 4 – Sine Deviation
- [ ] Visualize sine and tangent curves with an angle slider.
- [ ] Demonstrate tangent blow‑up near 90° along with a spring boundary effect.

## Scene 5 – Angle Reality Classification
- [ ] Create a three‑body gravity system with angle‑based coloring of interactions.
- [ ] Allow perspective switching between bodies to reveal spiral patterns.

## Scene 6 – Boundary Enforcement
- [ ] Implement the classic billiard algorithm to approximate π from collisions.
- [ ] Visualize elastic vs. inelastic thresholds along with emerging frequency patterns.

## Scene 7 – Prime Uniqueness
- [ ] Plot primes in an Ulam spiral and highlight composite trajectories.
- [ ] Allow users to change the block size of grid cells.

## Scene 8 – Multi‑Perspective Coherence
- [ ] Simulate boid flocking with cosine‑based alignment and obtuse‑angle dispersion.
- [ ] Show rotational patterns forming from local rules.

## Scene 9 – SEP Operationalization
- [ ] Visualize a 64‑bit state grid with QBSA rupture detection and QFH spectra.
- [ ] Illustrate coherence and decoherence events in real time.

## Scene 10 – Particle Fluid
- [ ] Provide a particle‑based fluid simulation colored by vorticity.
- [ ] Enforce boundary rotation to encourage stable lattice emergence.

## Scene 11 – Derivative Applications
- [ ] Plot a Black‑Scholes surface with boundary resampling.
- [ ] Overlay SEP path learning efficiency metrics.

## Scene 12 – Reality's Code
- [ ] Combine elements of all previous scenes into one meta‑visualization.
- [ ] Show primes as foundation points and coherence waves propagating through the scene.
