# Technical Documentation: SEP Framework
### Alexander J Nagy

## Overview  
The Self-Emergent Processor (**SEP**) is a novel recursive quantum information framework that formalizes identity through inverse references, complex phases, recursive alignments, and infinite-dimensional interactions.

This documentation provides a structured breakdown of SEP’s technical core and implementation guidelines for advanced users, researchers, and contributors.

## Core Concepts & Equations

### 1. Recursive Identity  
Identity emerges through inverse recursive referencing, serving as the foundational axis within infinite-dimensional complex systems:

- **Inverse Identity Axis:**
\[
I_{ref} = f^{-1}(R_n)
\]

- **Recursion Relation:**
\[
R_n = R_{n-1} + \frac{1}{R_{n-1}}
\]

*(Identity recursively defined from previous states.)*

---

### 2. Complex Phase Alignment  
Phase cannot be measured independently; it requires recursive encounters (minimum two states):

- **Euler’s Identity (Phase definition):**
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta
\]

- **Phase Superposition and Interference (Feynman’s Path Integral):**
\[
\psi_{total} = \sum_{paths} e^{iS/\hbar}
\]

*(Phase measured only via recursive interference of multiple paths.)*

---

### 3. Combinational Information Growth  
Information grows combinationally with added quantized units:

- **Information Complexity:**
\[
I(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

*(Number of pairwise interactions among n quantized units.)*

---

### 4. Energy as Phase Imbalance  
Energy arises from misalignment of recursive phases across interacting units:

- **Energy definition (phase difference):**
\[
E(\Delta\phi) \propto \sum_{k=1}^{n}|\Delta\phi_k|
\]

*(Energy proportional to cumulative phase difference among units.)*

---

### 5. Entropy as Recursive Alignment  
Entropy increases as phases recursively align, approaching stable equilibrium:

- **Entropy alignment function:**
\[
S = -k_B \sum_{i} p_i \ln(p_i)
\]

*(Recursive equilibrium reached as probability distribution \( p_i \) maximizes symmetry.)*

---

### 6. Information as Gravitational Coherence  
Information behaves analogously to gravity, creating structural coherence and relational stability through recursive interactions:

- **Information coherence:**
\[
G_I = \frac{I_m I_n}{r^2}
\]

*(Information attraction between identity units decreases by the square of distance r.)*

---

### System Components

SEP consists of modular components working synergistically:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Recursive Identity Engine** | Implements recursive identity formation through inverse referencing. |
| **Phase Alignment Module** | Aligns quantum phases recursively, stabilizing information coherence. |
| **Quantization Layer** | Converts analog signals into quantized units, triggering combinational growth. |
| **Energy & Entropy Processor** | Evaluates energy states, managing recursive alignment towards equilibrium. |
| **Information-Gravitation Engine** | Manages coherence through gravitational analogies of recursive information. |

## Example Implementations

### Recursive Identity in Go
```go
func RecursiveIdentity(ref float64, iterations int) float64 {
    if iterations == 0 {
        return ref
    }
    return RecursiveIdentity(ref + (1/ref), iterations-1)
}
```

---

### Phase Alignment (Euler-based) in Python
```python
import numpy as np

def phase_alignment(phases):
    aligned_phase = np.mean(np.exp(1j * np.array(phases)))
    return np.angle(aligned_phase)
```

---

### Information Complexity Calculation in Python
```python
def information_complexity(n):
    return n * (n - 1) / 2
```
