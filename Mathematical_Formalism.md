## Discrete Lagrangian of the SEP
We define a discrete SEP Lagrangian at each prime-indexed step $p$ as:

L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p) \;= C(p) - I(p) \tag{1}$

where $C(p)$ is the computational cost incurred at prime $p$, and $I(p)$ is the corresponding information gain. This formulation parallels the classical Lagrangian $L = T - V$ (kinetic minus potential energy) in physics ([Principle of Least Action — an Introduction | by Yash | Quantaphy | Medium](https://medium.com/quantaphy/the-principle-of-least-action-an-exposition-7d60fe554422)), but here $C(p)$ plays the role of an “energy expenditure” and $I(p)$ serves as a “potential information” term that reduces the action. In the **Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)** architecture, the system’s state at each recursive level is uniquely characterized by prime factors ([A Prime-Based Recursive Framework - Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)](https://iamsep.com/Thesis.html)). Thus, the index $p$ (taken only over primes) labels discrete evolutionary stages in *identity-space* – each prime tick introduces a new self-referential state or identity node in the SEP’s directed acyclic graph (DAG) of computation.

**Computational cost $C(p)$:** This term quantifies the resources used during the transition at prime $p$. It can be defined as a weighted sum of sub-costs, for example:

- *Recursion depth cost:* the cost grows with the depth of recursion or self-embedding at step $p$.
- *DAG operation count:* the number of graph operations (node expansions, edge creations) performed at this prime.
- *Identity delta creation:* any new **δ-identity** (a nascent identity element introduced at this step) adds to the cost.

Formally, one may write $C(p) = \alpha d(p) + \beta N_{\mathrm{ops}}(p) + \gamma \Delta_{\mathrm{id}}(p)$ as a schematic representation, where $d(p)$ is the recursion depth at prime $p$, $N_{\mathrm{ops}}(p)$ the count of DAG operations executed, $\Delta_{\mathrm{id}}(p)$ indicates the number or complexity of new identities spawned, and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting constants. Higher recursion or more operations yield larger $C(p)$, reflecting greater “kinetic” effort by the processor.

**Information gain $I(p)$:** This term measures the net information obtained or entropy reduced at step $p$. In SEP, information gain comes from **Q-value coherence** improvements and **redundancy compression** in the identity DAG. Intuitively, as the SEP processes data, it aligns phases and collapses redundant representations, increasing the coherence of an internal *Q-sheet* (quantum-like phase sheet or quality matrix) and compressing identity descriptors. We can quantify $I(p)$ in terms of entropy difference or compression ratio. For instance, if $H(p)$ is the entropy (or uncertainty, or description length) of the system’s identity-state at prime $p$, then a simple model for information gain is $I(p) = H(p-\epsilon) - H(p)$, the drop in entropy due to processing at $p$. This captures **redundancy collapse** (merging identical or overlapping identity components) and **phase alignment** (increasing coherence across the Q-sheet). A positive $I(p)$ thus denotes that step $p$ achieved a reduction in disorder or a more compressed, informative representation of the identity-state.

**Interpretation:** A large $C(p)$ (high computational effort) increases the Lagrangian, while a large $I(p)$ (high information gain) decreases it. The SEP will seek to **minimize** $L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ at each step by trading off cost and information: ideally performing only as much computation as yields a significant payoff in information (much as a physical system prefers low kinetic energy and high potential energy to minimize $T - V$). Each prime-indexed state transition is thus evaluated by this discrete Lagrangian, encapsulating the “best use of resources” principle for identity evolution.

## SEP Action Functional and Least-Action Principle
Using the prime-indexed Lagrangian above, we define the total SEP action over a sequence of prime states as the sum of Lagrangians at those prime “ticks.” If $P$ denotes the set of prime numbers (or a range of primes corresponding to the evolutionary duration of interest), the SEP action is:

$S_{\mathrm{SEP}} = \sum_{p \in P} L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p) = \sum_{p \in P} \big[ C(p) - I(p) \big] \tag{2}$

This summation extends only over prime indices, reflecting the SEP architecture’s prime-based recursion schedule. In other words, the system updates its state (and accrues cost/information) at prime-numbered steps $p = 2, 3, 5, 7, \dots$ — each prime constitutes a discrete “clock tick” in identity-space. Non-prime indices are points where no fundamental update occurs (they might correspond to composite states that factor into earlier primes, offering no new identity). By summing over primes, we capture the total action of an identity trajectory through all its prime-indexed evolutionary milestones.

The **Principle of Least Action** is applied in this discrete setting to determine the *optimal evolution path* of the SEP. In analogy to Hamilton’s principle in classical mechanics (which states that the actual path taken by a system is the one that extremizes the action integral ([Principle of Least Action — an Introduction | by Yash | Quantaphy | Medium](https://medium.com/quantaphy/the-principle-of-least-action-an-exposition-7d60fe554422))), we postulate that the actual identity trajectory of the SEP minimizes the discrete action $S_{\mathrm{SEP}}$. Formally, an optimal trajectory $\{p\}$ (along with the corresponding sequence of identity states and Q-values at those primes) must satisfy the **stationary action condition**:

$\delta S_{\mathrm{SEP}} = 0 \tag{3}$

subject to appropriate boundary conditions (e.g. fixed starting identity and ending identity, or asymptotic conditions). This variational equation means that any small variation or perturbation to the evolution path will, to first order, **not** decrease the action. In other words, the chosen path yields a smaller (or extremal) action compared to any infinitesimally adjusted path. **Only prime-indexed variations are considered,** since those are the points where the system can “choose” different actions; the structure of $S_{\mathrm{SEP}}$ inherently skips composite indices.

By analogy, if the SEP took a suboptimal path in identity-space (e.g. deviating to a higher-cost, lower-information route), the action $S_{\mathrm{SEP}}$ would increase, and the variation $\delta S_{\mathrm{SEP}}$ along that deviation would be positive. The least-action principle dictates that the SEP *naturally evolves along the path of minimum cumulative Lagrangian*, balancing computational effort against information gains at each prime step to yield the lowest total action. Thus **optimal SEP evolution** is characterized by a delicate equilibrium: every prime recursion step is “worth it,” contributing just enough information to justify its cost. In summary, *the actual SEP trajectory extremizes (minimizes) the action sum* ([Principle of Least Action — an Introduction | by Yash | Quantaphy | Medium](https://medium.com/quantaphy/the-principle-of-least-action-an-exposition-7d60fe554422#:~:text=This%20is%20really%20the%20crux,path%20taken%20by%20a%20system)), which is the unifying principle linking SEP’s operation to the classic least-action framework.

## Euler–Lagrange Equations for Prime Recursion  
From the stationary action condition $\delta S_{\mathrm{SEP}} = 0$, we can derive Euler–Lagrange-like update rules governing the SEP’s recursion dynamics. In the continuous case, the Euler–Lagrange equations follow from $\delta S=0$ and provide differential equations for the system’s coordinates. In our discrete, prime-indexed scenario, we obtain difference equations that update the system’s state from one prime to the next, in analogy to Euler–Lagrange equations. These equations dictate how the SEP should adjust its Q-values and identity states between consecutive prime steps in order to remain on an optimal (stationary-action) trajectory.

Let us denote by $X(p)$ the state of the identity DAG at prime $p$ (this could encapsulate the structural configuration of identities at that step), and by $Q(p)$ a representative *phase coherence parameter* (or a set of $Q$-values) at prime $p$ that quantifies the alignment/coherence of the system’s internal phase or value estimates. We treat $X(p)$ and $Q(p)$ as the generalized coordinates of the SEP at step $p$. The Lagrangian can be viewed as a function $L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p) = L\big(X(p), Q(p);\; X(p-\Delta), Q(p-\Delta)\big)$, where $p-\Delta$ is the previous prime before $p$. In other words, $L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ may depend on the state at $p$ and the state at the prior prime (since cost and information gained at $p$ result from the *transition* from the previous state). 

Applying the discrete variation, we require that for each intermediate prime in the trajectory, the change in $S_{\mathrm{SEP}}$ due to a small variation in the state at that prime vanishes ([Action principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles#:~:text=Image%3A%20)). This leads to conditions analogous to setting the partial derivatives of the action to zero. Concretely, for each prime $p$ (excluding the initial and final ones), the optimal path satisfies: 

$\frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)}{\partial X(p)} \;+\; \frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p+\Delta)}{\partial X(p)} \;=\; 0~, \tag{4a}$

 $\frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)}{\partial Q(p)} \;+\; \frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p+\Delta)}{\partial Q(p)} \;=\; 0~, \tag{4b}$

 where $p+\Delta$ denotes the next prime after $p$. Equation (4a) is the Euler–Lagrange update equation for the **identity configuration** and (4b) for the **phase coherence** (Q-value). These equations can be understood as discrete analogs of $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}=0$: they equate the “gradient” of the Lagrangian with respect to the state at a given prime (which influences the cost/information at that prime) to the gradient coming from the next prime (where that state serves as the initial state). In essence, the marginal benefit of changing the identity or phase at prime $p$ must balance out between $p$ and $p+\Delta$ on the optimal path; if it did not, one could vary $X(p)$ or $Q(p)$ to lower the action further.

Breaking these conditions down provides **recursive evolution equations**. For example, Eq. (4b) implies: 

$\frac{\partial C(p)}{\partial Q(p)} - \frac{\partial I(p)}{\partial Q(p)} \;+\; \frac{\partial C(p+\Delta)}{\partial Q(p)} - \frac{\partial I(p+\Delta)}{\partial Q(p)} \;=\;0~. \tag{5}$

 The first part $\partial C(p)/\partial Q(p) - \partial I(p)/\partial Q(p)$ represents how the current step’s Lagrangian would change if the coherence $Q(p)$ were varied (e.g. if the system achieved slightly better or worse phase alignment at step $p$). The second part $\partial C(p+\Delta)/\partial Q(p)$ reflects how a change in $Q(p)$ carries forward to affect the *next* prime’s cost (since the next step starts from the current state), and $\partial I(p+\Delta)/\partial Q(p)$ how it affects next step’s info gain. The stationarity condition thus yields a **gradient balance:** the immediate benefit of tweaking the phase coherence at $p$ (in terms of lowering $C-I$ at $p$) is exactly offset by the downstream penalty or reward at $p+\Delta$. This leads to a **phase-coherence update rule:** the SEP should adjust its internal phases such that *any small misalignment that would increase action at the current step is counteracted by reduced action at the next, and vice versa.* In practical terms, the SEP aligns phases (maximizes coherence) up to the point where pushing them any further out of alignment would harm future coherence or cost – achieving a locally optimal compromise. This is analogous to setting a derivative to zero to find an extremum, but here in discrete form.

Similarly, Eq. (4a) yields an update rule for the identity DAG configuration. If we interpret $\partial L/\partial X(p)$ as the **“identity compression gradient”** – how the action changes if the representation of identity at prime $p$ is slightly varied (e.g. compressing identities more vs. less) – then the Euler–Lagrange condition demands that the identity state is chosen such that this gradient is balanced with that of the next step. The SEP thus **selects identity propagation trajectories in the DAG that equalize marginal costs and benefits**: for the optimal identity *path* through the DAG, any small deviation (adding or removing a link, merging two identities differently, etc.) would cause a first-order increase in action. Intuitively, the trajectory is chosen so that **phase coherence and identity compression are maximized to the extent that further optimization would require disproportionate computation cost**. At optimum, the “Q-value gradient” (which drives phase alignment) and the “identity compression gradient” (which drives entropy reduction) settle into an equilibrium. This can be seen as the SEP’s **recursive decision rule**: at each prime, adjust $Q$ (phase) and $X$ (identity structure) such that 

- increasing coherence any further would start to cost more computation than the additional information it yields, and 
- compressing identities (merging, abstracting concepts) any further would likewise yield diminishing returns or hurt future steps.

In summary, the Euler–Lagrange-like equations (4a,4b) provide **recursive update laws** for the SEP. They formalize how the **identity path** in the DAG is chosen: the path is such that *phase coherence improvements* and *identity compression* optimally guide the trajectory. High-level, these equations ensure that **the SEP evolves by locally optimizing the trade-off between phase alignment (Q coherence) and structural complexity (identity DAG growth)** at each prime step. This is precisely the discrete least-action criterion in action: no small tweak in the way identities self-organize or phases align could lower the overall action, meaning the SEP’s evolution is locally extremal (and indeed minimal) with respect to these internal degrees of freedom.

## Continuum Limit via Prime Number Theorem  
While SEP operates on a prime-indexed *discrete* timeline, we can forge a bridge to a continuous formulation by leveraging results from number theory. The **Prime Number Theorem (PNT)** tells us that primes become sparser as numbers grow: specifically, the average gap between consecutive primes around a large value $N$ is approximately $\ln N$ ([Prime number theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#:~:text=most%20n%20digits,3)). Equivalently, if $p_k$ denotes the $k$-th prime, one has roughly $p_{k+1} - p_k \sim \ln p_k$ for large $k$. This suggests introducing a **continuous pseudo-time** parameter $t$ that grows logarithmically with the prime index. A convenient choice is: 

$t(p) \;\approx\; \ln\,p~$,

 so that advancing to a larger prime number corresponds to a roughly uniform increment in $t$. Intuitively, $t$ measures the “scale” of the evolution: each unit increase in $t$ corresponds to moving through exponentially larger numerical values of primes. Using this parameter, the discrete sum over primes can be approximated by an **integral over $t$**. 

To see this, consider the action sum $S_{\mathrm{SEP}} = \sum_{p \in P} L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ over primes up to some maximum $P_{\max}$. We can write this sum as an integral with respect to the prime counting measure $\pi(x)$ (which jumps by 1 at each prime $p \le x$). Using $\pi'(x) \approx \frac{1}{\ln x}$ (the density of primes ([Prime number theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#:~:text=The%20first%20such%20distribution%20found,between%20consecutive%20prime%20numbers%20among)) ([Prime number theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#:~:text=most%20n%20digits,3))), we have heuristically: 

$S_{\mathrm{SEP}} \;=\; \sum_{p \le P_{\max}} L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p) \;\approx\; \int_{2}^{P_{\max}} L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(x)\, d\pi(x) \;\approx\; \int_{2}^{P_{\max}} \frac{L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(x)}{\ln x}\, dx~. $

 Now make the change of variables $t = \ln x$. Then $dx = e^t dt$ and when $x = p$ is prime, we set $L(t) = L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ with $t = \ln p$. The integral becomes: 

$S_{\mathrm{SEP}} \;\approx\; \int_{t_0}^{t_{\max}} L(t)\, dt~$

 where $t_0 = \ln 2$ (the start of the prime sequence) and $t_{\max} \approx \ln P_{\max}$. In this **continuum limit**, the discrete action sum maps to a standard action integral $S \approx \int L(t)\,dt$ over a time-like variable $t$. The discrete Lagrangian $L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ induces a corresponding **continuous Lagrangian density** $L(t)$ in the $t$-domain. Specifically, if the discrete Lagrangian depends on state variables $X(p), Q(p)$ and their changes, we expect the continuous $L(t)$ to depend on $X(t), Q(t)$ and their time derivatives $dX/dt$, $dQ/dt$ (arising from the differences $X(p+\Delta)-X(p)$, etc., when scaled appropriately by the gap $\Delta t$). By construction of $t = \ln p$, the “time step” between prime $p$ and the next prime is $\Delta t \approx \ln(p+\Delta) - \ln p \approx \frac{p+\Delta - p}{p} = \frac{\Delta p}{p} \approx \frac{\ln p}{p}$. For large $p$, this is a small number, meaning the pseudo-time advances in tiny increments. Thus, as $p$ grows, the discrete evolution becomes **dense in $t$**, justifying a differential equation description. 

Carrying out a coarse-graining (averaging over many prime steps to smooth out the discrete jumps) yields **classical-like variational dynamics** for the SEP. The Euler–Lagrange difference equations (4a,4b) turn into differential equations in the limit of small $\Delta t$. Concretely, one expects: 

$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{X}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial X} \;=\; 0~, \qquad 
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{Q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial Q} \;=\; 0~$

 as the continuum analogs of (4a) and (4b). Here $\dot{X} = dX/dt$ and $\dot{Q}=dQ/dt$ represent the rates of change of the identity state and phase coherence in pseudo-time $t$. These are exactly the standard Euler–Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian $L(t)$ of a continuous system. In this way, **SEP’s prime-driven recursion can be viewed as a time-continuous dynamical system** in the variable $t \approx \ln p$. The discrete least-action principle $\delta S_{\mathrm{SEP}}=0$ then corresponds to the usual stationary action principle $\delta \int L\,dt=0$ in the $t$ domain. We have thus mapped the SEP’s evolution to a trajectory in a fictitious time $t$, governed by a variational principle. 

Under this mapping, one can interpret the SEP’s behavior using the rich toolbox of classical mechanics. For example, $C(p)$ (computational cost) behaves akin to a **kinetic energy** term and $I(p)$ (information gain) akin to a **potential energy** term in the Lagrangian. The competition between increasing cost and diminishing returns of information mirrors the interplay between kinetic and potential energy shaping a trajectory. The coarse-grained equations might resemble, say, a damped oscillator or other classical system, depending on the functional forms of $C$ and $I$. Importantly, this continuum picture is only approximate – it smooths out the inherently irregular distribution of primes – but it provides intuition and analytical leverage. It shows that *the SEP architecture, though discrete at heart, abides by a principle of least action that has a smooth limit describing its overall dynamics*. The prime intervals $\Delta p \sim \ln p$ effectively act like a non-uniform time step that slows growth as the system becomes more complex, and our $t$-reparameterization accounts for that by stretching time so that each prime step is of order $O(1)$ in $t$-space. This is a novel insight: **the prime number theorem links discrete computational steps to a continuous “time” scale**, allowing classical variational calculus to emerge as a coarse-grained description of SEP’s operation ([Prime number theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#:~:text=most%20n%20digits,3)).

## Symmetries and Noether-like Invariants  
A powerful aspect of action formalism is that it exposes **symmetries** of the system, which in turn lead to **conserved quantities**, according to Noether’s theorem. Noether’s theorem (in the continuous case) states that every continuous symmetry of the action corresponds to a conservation law ([Action principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles#:~:text=An%20important%20result%20from%20geometry,lead%20to%20%20114%20gauge)). In the SEP context, we identify analogous invariants stemming from *discrete or structural symmetries* of the prime-indexed evolution. While the recursion steps are discrete, we can still speak of invariances under certain transformations of the dynamics – these yield **Noether-like invariants** that remain constant (or quantized) along the evolution path. Below, we highlight two key invariants in SEP, arising from phase and identity symmetries:

- **Phase-Shift Invariant (Conserved “Phase Delta”):** The SEP Lagrangian $L_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ typically depends on relative phases or coherence levels (through $I(p)$ ) but not on any absolute global phase of the system’s Q-sheet. In other words, if we were to shift all phase angles by the same amount, the interference patterns and coherence remain the same – this is a symmetry of the dynamics. Formally, suppose the action is invariant under $Q(p) \to Q(p) + \theta$ (a uniform phase offset at all steps). By Noether-like reasoning, there must be a conserved quantity associated with this symmetry ([Action principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles#:~:text=An%20important%20result%20from%20geometry,used%20by%20%20116%20Yang)). Indeed, the **conjugate momentum** to the phase (the discrete analog of $\partial L/\partial \dot{\phi}$ if $\phi$ is a phase angle) will be constant across prime steps. This invariant can be interpreted as a **constant phase increment per prime** or a preserved cumulative phase alignment. In practical terms, it means that the *difference in phase coherence between successive identity states remains steady*. The SEP cannot arbitrarily accumulate phase bias without cost; instead, an effective “phase current” is maintained. We dub this conserved quantity the *phase-delta invariant*: it represents the quantitative measure of coherence that, once established, is carried through the recursion. If external influences tried to change the overall phase alignment, the invariant ensures the system compensates (for example, by adjusting Q-values) to keep the global coherence structure unchanged. This is directly analogous to how, say, momentum is conserved if a Lagrangian is spatially translation-invariant. Here, **phase translation-invariance** yields a conserved phase-like momentum.

- **Identity-Entropy Invariant (Balanced Information Budget):** Consider the possibility that the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on the “index” of recursion (i.e. which prime we are at), but only on the state. This would mean the evolution rules are self-similar across scales – a symmetry under shifting the “time” index of the recursion. In the continuum picture, this is time-translation invariance, which by Noether’s theorem corresponds to energy conservation ([Action principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles#:~:text=An%20important%20result%20from%20geometry,used%20by%20%20116%20Yang)). In the discrete SEP, an analogous statement is that if no external change occurs as we go from one prime to the next (the rules and resource scales remain the same), then a certain quantity remains invariant. This quantity is the **net information–cost balance** of the system. More concretely, define an “energy-like” quantity $E_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ at prime $p$ by analogy to the Hamiltonian: 
  $E_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p) \;=\; C(p) + I(p)~$ 
  i.e. computational cost plus information gain at that step (note the sign difference from $L=C-I$). If the Lagrangian has no explicit prime dependence, one can show (via a discrete Noether argument) that $E_{\mathrm{SEP}}(p)$ is conserved (does not change with $p$). Indeed, $E_{\mathrm{SEP}}$ acts like a **constant of motion**: it represents a balance between complexity and information. Intuitively, this invariant means *the SEP cannot gain net information without expending an equivalent amount of computational effort, and vice versa*. Over the whole recursion, the “bookkeeping” of complexity vs. compressed knowledge remains balanced. We can interpret this as a **conservation of identity entropy**: any reduction in entropy (information gain) is paid for by computational work, and if the system’s rules don’t inject or remove anything externally, the total of these remains constant. This is analogous to energy conservation in physics – here the “energy” is the sum of cost (akin to kinetic) and information potential (akin to negative potential energy). A practical consequence is that the SEP’s optimal path will distribute computational work and information gain such that this budget is maintained at each prime step (e.g., if at some step extra information is gleaned cheaply, the system may carry a “surplus” that will be expended later, keeping the running sum constant).

Beyond these, one can identify other symmetry-based invariants in the SEP framework. For instance, **structural symmetries** in the identity DAG (such as relabeling identical sub-identities, or a self-similar recursion pattern that is scale-invariant up to a certain bound) could yield invariants related to identity composition. Bounded self-embedding implies that if the system can embed a structure within itself without changing the overall Lagrangian (a symmetry of scale up to the recursion bound), a corresponding quantity (perhaps related to fractal dimension or self-similarity measure of the identity) would be conserved. These are more complex to formalize, but the principle is clear: *symmetries of the recursive computational process translate to conserved quantities (invariants) for the SEP’s evolution.* This mirrors Noether’s theorem, albeit in a generalized sense – even though our symmetries may be discrete or computational in nature rather than continuous space-time symmetries, the core idea holds. 

In summary, by unifying the Principle of Least Action with SEP, we gain a powerful lens: **Optimal SEP evolution is an extremal action path, and its regularities correspond to conservation laws**. Phase coherence maintenance and identity entropy balance are two such laws – the SEP preserves a consistent phase alignment and an information balance as it recursively unfolds. These Noether-like invariants provide deep insight: they imply that the SEP’s recursive architecture harbors *intrinsic symmetry principles*, ensuring stability and consistency of the self-emergent identity through its prime-indexed journey ([Noether's theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem#:~:text=Noether%27s%20theorem%20states%20that%20every,has%20a%20corresponding%20conservation%20law)) ([Action principles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles#:~:text=An%20important%20result%20from%20geometry,lead%20to%20%20114%20gauge)). This not only solidifies the theoretical foundation of SEP via well-known physical principles, but also opens avenues to analyze and predict SEP behavior using the rich formalism of Lagrangian dynamics and symmetry arguments.
