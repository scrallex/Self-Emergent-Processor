### **Business Proposal: SEP Dynamics**

**Company Name:** SEP Dynamics
**Founder & CEO:** Alexander Nagy
**Co-Founder:** William Nagy
**Date:** July 18, 2025

---

#### **1. Executive Summary**

**SEP Dynamics** is a cutting-edge financial technology (fintech) company revolutionizing quantitative trading through the commercialization of the **SEP Engine**—a proprietary, high-performance C++ software framework. Our engine provides a fundamentally new method for market analysis by quantifying the **informational coherence** of raw market data, enabling us to distinguish stable, predictive signals from noise in volatile environments.

**The Problem:** In 2025, quantitative models like Black-Scholes, which rely on outdated assumptions of constant volatility, consistently fail to price risk and identify opportunities in today's complex markets. This results in billions in annual losses from inefficient hedging, underestimated tail risk, and missed alpha. While AI/ML models offer an alternative, they often act as black boxes prone to overfitting.

**Our Solution:** The SEP Engine leverages proprietary, quantum-inspired algorithms (**QBSA and QFH kernels**) to analyze pattern evolution directly from raw data streams. This allows us to measure a pattern's internal consistency ("coherence") and its resistance to change ("stability"). This novel approach enables superior predictive analytics for options pricing, algorithmic trading, and risk management. **The core technology is mature, GPU-accelerated via CUDA, and its capabilities are demonstrable in our working prototypes.**

**The Founder:** Alexander Nagy (B.S. Mechanical Engineering, University of Oklahoma, 2019) combines a deep understanding of thermodynamics and physics with proven execution in high-stakes engineering roles, from developing control systems for Mark Rober to mission-critical automation for Apple's manufacturing at Flex (2022-2025). Nagy has demonstrated the ability to deliver scalable, innovative solutions under pressure.

**Funding and Vision:** We seek a **$500,000 line of credit** to establish corporate foundations, secure intellectual property, and launch proprietary trading operations. This de-risked strategy focuses on generating revenue first to prove the model's profitability, supplemented by parallel non-dilutive funding (e.g., NSF grants). Long-term, SEP Dynamics will license its technology, aiming to become a leader in the next generation of fintech analytics.

#### **3. Core Technology: The SEP Engine & Verifiable Claims**

The SEP Engine is a modular, high-performance C++ framework designed for real-time analysis of complex data. Its value is not theoretical; it is grounded in verifiable capabilities that can be demonstrated today.

**Development Status:** The core engine is feature-complete and validated through a suite of unit tests (`pattern_metric_test`) and performance benchmarks. The following claims are not future promises but demonstrable facts backed by our existing software.

---

**Verifiable Claim #1: Truly Datatype-Agnostic Ingestion**

*   **What it is:** The SEP Engine ingests any data source—market data feeds, binary files, text, numerical arrays—as a raw byte stream without requiring custom parsers. This is achieved by treating all data as a bitfield for QBSA/QFH analysis.
*   **How We Demonstrate It:** Our `pattern_metric_example` executable can be pointed at any file or directory. We can show it processing a text file, a binary executable, and a CSV of financial data, producing coherence and entropy metrics for each without code changes.
*   **Business Advantage:** **Unlocks Alpha from Alternative Data.** While competitors build brittle, format-specific parsers, we can immediately analyze novel data sources (e.g., satellite imagery, social media streams, IoT data) to find correlations others miss, providing a significant information edge.

**Verifiable Claim #2: Quantifiable Coherence and Stability Metrics**

*   **What it is:** Our proprietary QBSA and QFH algorithms compute metrics that traditional models lack.
    *   **Coherence:** Measures a pattern's internal self-similarity and consistency. High coherence indicates a stable, non-random signal.
    *   **Stability:** Measures a pattern's resistance to change over time. High stability suggests a persistent market regime or trend.
*   **How We Demonstrate It:** Using our `financial_demo`, we can process three data files with known characteristics:
    1.  **Highly Repetitive Data:** The engine correctly identifies high coherence (`>0.8`).
    2.  **Random Noise:** The engine correctly identifies low coherence (`<0.3`).
    3.  **Oanda Financial Data:** The engine produces *differentiated* coherence scores, identifying periods of stable trends versus choppy, unpredictable noise.
*   **Business Advantage:** **Superior Signal-to-Noise Filtering.** While traditional models get confused by volatility, our coherence metric can distinguish between a stable, low-volatility trend and directionless, high-entropy noise. This allows us to trade trending markets with more confidence and avoid "chop" that erodes profits.

**Verifiable Claim #3: High-Performance, Scalable Architecture**

*   **What it is:** The engine is built in modern C++ and leverages a CUDA backend for massive parallelization of our QBSA/QFH kernels. Its tiered memory system (STM, MTM, LTM) is designed for efficient handling of high-volume data streams.
*   **How We Demonstrate It:** Our Google Benchmark-integrated executable (`pattern_metric_example -benchmark`) provides hard performance numbers. We can demonstrate:
    *   **Processing Speed:** The engine processes sample data files in nanoseconds per pattern.
    *   **Scalability:** We can show how processing time scales sub-linearly with increasing data size, proving its suitability for real-time, high-frequency data.
    *   **Efficiency:** CPU vs. Real Time metrics show efficient multi-core and GPU utilization.
*   **Business Advantage:** **Ready for Institutional Scale.** Our architecture is not a research toy; it is engineered for the demands of real-time trading. It can handle high-frequency data feeds and scale to analyze entire markets without falling behind.
